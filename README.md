# AthensPong
Educational Java game developed in the Athens programme at TU Delft

The purpose of this project is to learn some software design patterns and implement them in the code.
We implemented the Singleton pattern in the Ball class, so only one ball would be displayed.
We used the Strategy pattern, which is usefull for using different algorithims in run time. The Ball class moves
in different directions depending on wether it collides with the walls or the paddles, so we defined diferent classes for each 
movement.

# AthensPong
Educational Java game developed in the Athens programme at TU Delft

This is the second version of a pong based on a (simpler) code by the GitHub user mihneadb.
As we werenÂ´t capable of finishing a fully working game, we thougt it would be better to use an already written code,
understand how it is structured and apply the patterns on it.
